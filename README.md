I have analyzed the dataset - Adidas US Sales for the year 2020-2021 and created an interactive dashboard, pivot tables and pivot charts with the help of MS-Excel.

Findings:

We can see that the 'West US Region' has the highest number of sales(units sold).
'Online sales method' has the highest percentage of operating margin as compared to in-store/outlet.
'West Gear' has sold the most number of Adidas shoes as compared to the other 4 retailers.
Out of the 6 product categories, 'Men's Street Footwear' is the top selling product category.
